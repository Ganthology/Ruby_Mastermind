# Ruby Mastermind
This is part of **The Odin Project**, Fullstack Ruby on Rails track curriculum. This project is to build a [Mastermind game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)).
## Description
A game has a maximum of 12 rounds. Players need to break the secret code set by the codemaker within the rounds limit. The secret code is made up of combination of 4 colors out of the 6 color option provided. 

Players can decide their next move after considering the hint message given each round. A Red peg will be given if one code is in correct place and color. A White peg will be given if one code is correct color but in the wrong place. A sample hint message will be ```"RRWW"```, indicating the codes are all correct in color, but two is out of place.
